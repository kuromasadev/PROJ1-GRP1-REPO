5 - Analyze the data. Look for patterns and correlations between food choices, music choices, and game season attendance in each city. For example, do people like a certain type of food also tend to attend certain game season or listen to certain types of music?

6 - Draw conclusions. Based on the analysis, draw conclusions about the intersection of culture in each city. What are the commonalities and differences between cities? What factors may be influencing these cultural patterns?

7 - Can use data visualizations, charts, maps, and narratives to tell the story of the cultural intersection you have explored.
