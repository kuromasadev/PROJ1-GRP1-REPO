# Week 1 Documentation

### Proposed approach

1 - Identify the cities which want to study that may influence the intersection of culture you are interested in. And find the team have how many home games will play within 2014-2021 

  AFC North (Pittsburgh Steelers)
  NFC South (Carolina Panthers)

2 - Gather data on food choices. Look for data on what types of food are popular within game season. We can use online food ordering platforms, food blogs, restaurant review sites, and social media to gather this information.

###### **Food documentation can be found in the** [Yelp Docs](https://github.com/kuromasadev/PROJ1-GRP1-REPO/blob/main/Resources/YELP/Docs_YelpDataset.md)

3 - Collect data on music choices. Look for data on what types of music are popular in each team's fans. You can use music streaming platforms, music blogs, and social media to gather this information.

###### **World Charts documentation can be found in the** [Kworb Docs](https://github.com/kuromasadev/PROJ1-GRP1-REPO/blob/main/Resources/WORLDCHARTS/Docs_kworbDataset.md)

4 - Collect data on sports attendance. Look for data on those two teams people support, and how often they attend games. You can use sports news sites, social media, and ticketing sites to gather this information.

5 - Analyze the data. Look for patterns and correlations between food choices, music choices, and game season attendance in each city. For example, do people like a certain type of food also tend to attend certain game season or listen to certain types of music?

6 - Draw conclusions. Based on the analysis, draw conclusions about the intersection of culture in each city. What are the commonalities and differences between cities? What factors may be influencing these cultural patterns?

7 - Can use data visualizations, charts, maps, and narratives to tell the story of the cultural intersection you have explored.

## Findings 

#### Music 

##### World Charts 



##### Digital Streams (Spotify)

At NFL games, jingles, theme songs and social media are likely to use the top charting songs around the world to promote their team brand. 

Question: Across the NFL seasons (2015-2021), what is the graphical categorization of song durations?

**Findings**:

1. Between the seasons, there is a consistent peak of longer songs, most likely due to the holidays. 
2. There has been a decline in long songs over the last five years, most songs are "radio ready". (between 2 and 3 minutes)
3. During the typical NFL season, there is less music streamed between weeks 8, 9 and 10. These are the first weeks of October and beginning of November.

***Regarding the 3-minute "limit"*** 

> There have always been some type of restriction as it relates to the vehicle that carries music, ie. the storage technology. 

- The phonograph disc, which rotated at 78rpm could hold about 3 minutes. 
- In the 1960's, where the smaller disc which rotated at 45rpm could hold about 3 minutes. 
- In the turn of the millennia, CD-ROMS could hold about 20 songs of 3 minutes each
